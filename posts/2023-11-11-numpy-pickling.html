    <h1>Confused about Numpy's No Copy Pickling</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>This is a reference post for my future self about how pickling works witn numpy arrays.</p>

    <p>In version 1.6 numpy introduced <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/1.16.0-notes.html#no-copy-pickling-of-numpy-arrays">no copy pickling for numpy arrays</a>. 
    Quoting from the release notes: </p>

    <blockquote>
      <b>no-copy pickling of numpy arrays: </b> <br>
      Up to protocol 4, numpy array pickling created 2 spurious copies of the data being serialized. 
      With pickle protocol 5, and the PickleBuffer API, a large variety of numpy arrays can now be serialized without any copy using out-of-band buffers, and with one less copy using in-band buffers. 
      This results, for large arrays, in an up to 66% drop in peak memory usage.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      While the release notes only emphasize large drops in memory usage,
      the promise of the title is that no copy pickling is possible.
      Adding to this, the corresponding <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12011">PR</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11161"> issue </a> 
      and <a href="https://gist.github.com/ogrisel/a2b0e5ae4987a398caa7f9277cb3b90a"> related benchmarking </a>
      also emphasize no copy for large mutable buffers. All of this,
      was enabled by PEP 574, which introduced the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0574/"> pickle protocol 5 </a>. This is very relevant in the contex of multiprocessing in 
      python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager"> as objets are pickled to be sent to other processes </a>.

    </p>

    <h2> In-band pickling</h2>
    <p> Here in-band means the traditional way of pickling, where the data is serialized in the pickle stream itself. Whereas out-of-band means that the 
      data is serialized in a separate buffer, and the pickle stream contains a reference to that buffer. </p>
      
    <p> From the release notes, and the PEP also emphasizes this point, it would seem that even
      for normal pickling the number of copies and therefore the memory consumption should reduce 
      if we switch from protocol 4 (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format"> the default protocol at least until python 3.12 </a>) 
      to protocol 5 </p>

    <p> Let's test this: </p>

    <p> Despite using protocol 5, the memory footprint increases 
      when we unpickle (which was expected) but also when pickled (which was unexpected) to me. </p>
      I am probably misunderstanding something.

      Up to protocol 4, numpy array pickling created 2 spurious copies of the data being serialized. 
      With pickle protocol 5, and the PickleBuffer API, a large variety of numpy arrays can now be serialized without any copy using out-of-band buffers, and with one less copy using in-band buffers. This results, for large arrays, in an up to 66% drop in peak memory usage.

    <p> Despite using protocol 5, the memory footprint increased significantly after pickling and unpickling, which was unexpected </p>

    <p> I tried installing python=3.7 as I suspected that maybe numpy fallbacks to 5 features always and therefore I will not see the difference between them in python > 3.8
      But I remember that they had a fallaback mechnanism already for that in the PR. So maybe the way to go is to generate non-contigious array
      That is, I wanted to see if that produced more memory allocations but it did not.  </p>
    <p>What I could be doing wrong?It raised questions about the specific conditions under which zero-copy pickling with protocol 5 shows its benefi.</p>

  <p>
    The PR that introduced this feature was called "No copy pickling of numpy arrays" and it was merged in 2018:
    <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11161">PR</a>.
  </p>

  <p> This is the link to the code <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/8568549c93a404df415244053affda5df02eb8e1/numpy/_core/src/multiarray/methods.c#L1913-L1941"> github </a></p>
  
  <p>I am not even getting improvements with respect to protocol 4. This is the output :
